## Hello World!
 
My name is Selby Onyango and I’m a senior at Texas State University and a first year Computer Science major with a minor in Applied Mathematics. I am completely new to the world of tech and computers but ever since I fell in love with programming (just recently too) I’ve made it my personal mission to learn as much as I can to further my knowledge and skillset. This blog will showcase a lot of what I’m currently learning via my posts as well as my current learning goals. Check out my personal portfolio on Github and my LinkedIn page and feel free to contact me at any time!
